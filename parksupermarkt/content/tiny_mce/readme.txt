ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY
------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a custom instance of the TinyMCE editor
available under the GNU LGPL. This custom instance contains
only a subset of the editor's original functionality, and is
taylored to fit the needs of one special application of the
TinyMCE editor.

This custom instance of the TinyMCE editor does not contain
any modified code. It is fully compliant to the distributed
original version of the editor. What we did was just leaving
some functionality out we did not need (eg. most of the
plugins the TinyMCE distribution usually contains).

Since the TinyMCE editor is distributed under the GNU LPGL
license and this directory contains a taylored version of this
editor, the contents of this directory can be regarded
as a derivative of TinyMCE. As such, the directory contents
are themselves distributed under the GNU LGPL.

You can find the license in the file license.txt.

The original TinyMCE software can be obtained from
http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/, which we highly recommend
if you want to do any modifications to the source code.
